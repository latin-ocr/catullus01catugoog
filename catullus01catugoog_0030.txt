way northward Even the gaiety with which the dedicatory
inscription of the model of the phasellus (c. 4) is struck off, -

Rome. His reappearance among his old friends is marked by
a single poem (c. 10),whose gay and charming humor shows
that even the vicinity of Lesbia had lost its power constantly
to embitter his thoughts. And to the passion ior Lesbia now
appears to have succeeded that for a boy, Juventius, with the
charms of whose company Catullus perhaps attempted to drive
out the thoughts of his former love. How the intimacy began
we cannot tell. The Juventian gens sprang from Tusculum,
but inscriptions (C. 1. L. vol. V. passim) show that people ol

Juventius he had only sorrowful remonstrance (cc. 24, 81).
