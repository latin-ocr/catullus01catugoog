xlil INTRODUCI'ION.

which a part, with lives of Cato aud of Atticus, is still extant,
but also of other historical works (cf. c. 1. 6 n.) and of poems
(Plin. Ep. V. 3. 6).

65. Q. Hortensius Ortalus (114-50 n.c.), Cicero’s greatest
rival as au orator, was also somewhat of a historian (Vell. II.
16. 3), and wrote erotic poems (Ov. Trist. Il. 4413 Pliu. Ep.
V. 3. 5), which the Greeks at the banquet of Antonius Julianus
(Gell. XIX. 9. 7) characterized as inuenusto, though they
admitted that Catullus and Calvus wrote some verses compara-
ble with those of Anacreon. Presuming, perhaps, upon his owu
gifts as a poet, Hortensius asked Catullus fora poem (c. 65.
18-19), and the poet complied with the request, though with
an absence of compliment that indicates no intimate friendship
with his petitioner, whose much greater age and high position
gave him, however, the power to become au influential patron.
That the friendship made no progress seems to be indicated by
the uncomplimentary allusion to the verses of Hortensius in
c. 95. 3 (cf. however ἕ ²5 odfin).

⁶6. The Varus of c. 10 is apparently identical with the Varus
of c. aa, who is a friend of Catullus and a critic of poetry, if not
a poet himself. This may well be the distinguished Quintilius
Varus, the Augustan critic (Hor. A. P. 438 fs.) and poet (Acro
and Comm. Cruq. on l.c.). He is called a native of Cre·
mona 3 and his death in 23 rac. (according to Jerome) drew
from Horace a touching address of sympathy to Vergil (Carm.
Ι. 24). Judged from the tone of the passage in the Ars
Portica, Quintilius must have been somewhat older than
Horace, while yet he could hardly have been born long, if at
all, before Catullus. The attempt to identify the Vams of c. ro
and c. 22 with Alfenus Varus of c. 30 is unsatisfactory.

67. The Manlius Torquatus, whose marriage with Vinia
Aumnculeia is celebrated in c. 61, was perhaps the L. Manlius
Torquatus whose father was consul in 65 ae. (cf. Hor. Carm.
111.21.1; Epod. 13. 6), and who was himself praetor in 49.
He allied himself with the Pompeians, aud was killed in Africa
