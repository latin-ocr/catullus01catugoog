62. ‘l'neCatotowhomc56 is addressedwas probablynot
that pattern of ancient Roman stricturam, M. Porcius Cato,
later called Uticensis, but the grammarian, Valerius Caro, whc
was a countryman of Catullus (Suet. Grom. 11), and whose
amatory poems are mentioned by Ovid (Trist. II. 43⁶) in
connection with those ol Cinna (cf. i 63), Cornificius (ci.
5 61), and Anser.

63. C. Helvius Cinna, a companion of Catullus on the suh
οἰ Memmius (ci c. ro. 3ο and ἕ 3ο), whose epic poem, the
Zmyrna, is praised in c. 95, was probably the Caesarian tribune
mistalren for 1. Cornelius Cinna, the anti-Caesarian, iu the riots
attending the funeral of Julius Caesar, and killed by the popu·
lace (Plut. Brut. 20, Iul. 683 Suet. Iul. 85 ; cf. Shalrspere Jul.
Cos. III. 3). The insignificant extant fragments of his poems
are appended hy 1. Muner to his edition of Catullus.

64 The Cornelius of c. 1. 1 seems to be Cornelius Nepos, the
historian3 witness Ausonius, w'no says (XXIII. 1-3) ‘cat . ..
libeffum' Veronensa aitpoeta quondam, inuentoque dedu statim
Nepoti. Nepos (circ. 94-24 nc.) was certainly a provincial
from Cisalpine Gaul (Plin. N. H. III. 127 Nepos Pord’ accola),
and probably a native of Ticinum (Plin. Ep. IV. 28. ις
Mommsen in Hermes III. p. 62). His acquaintance with
Catullus, though nothing certain can be traced concerning it,
was doubtless sostered by their similarity of origin (cf. § rr).
Nepos was author not only os the work De Vt'nlr Illustn‘bus. ol
