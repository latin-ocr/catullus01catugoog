these proffers now made to him through, and by, Furius and
Aurelius were definitely and disdainfully rejected (c. 11),-
with amanly, not a petulaut disdain, lor Catullus could not
even then forget that he had loved Lesbia.

42· This manly utterance was almost the last of the poet's
life. A few scattered verses there may have been, closing per-
haps with the touching appeal written from Verona (ci. ἕ 56)
to his brother-poet, Cornificius, for a word of consolation, but
that was all, and sometime in the year 54 rac, in his beloved
Rome, so says the chronicler, the swiftly buming candle of his
lise bumed itself out.

43. With him died the clearest, if not the richest, poet-voice
ever lifted in Rome. He lacked the losty grandeur of Lucre·
tius, the polished stateliness of Vergil, the broad sympathies
of Horace. For on the one hand, he was no recluse to be
filled with heavenly visions, and on the oth‘er, his personality
was too intense to allow him to cultivate a tolerant spirit. He
delighted in life with a vigorous animal passion. Not without
charm to him was nature in her sylvan aspect (cf. eg. a. 34. 9 ff.)
yet his highest enjoyment was in the life of men. And this lift
he did not study, as did Horace, from the standpoint of a
philosopher. Indeed, he did not study it at all, but simply felt
it. = For he was not outside of it, but a part of it to the fullest
degree, swayed by its ever-changing emotions. Such a nature
must of necessity ever remain in many essential aspects the
nature of a child. And such was the nature of Catullu
throughout his brief lise,-warm in quiclr affectione, hot in
swist hatreds, pulsing with most active red blood.

44. Τὴε great maj0rity oi his verses-'all the most suc.
cessful of them-are the direct expression ol his own heart
at the moment. No poet was ever more unreserved, more
persectly ingenuous. And yet, such is the facility of his genius
and the excellence of his taste, his verses show no ruggedness
