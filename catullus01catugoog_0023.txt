xxii INTRODUCTION.

him suddenly thither from Rome. For a time this emotion
dulled his sensibility to every other. He could think of noth-
ing else. He loreswore the Muses forever, save to express the
burden of his woe (cc. 68. 193 65. 12). To the request ol the
influential orator Hortensius for verses, he could send onlya
translation from Callimachus, and the story of his tears. He
must even deny (c. 68⁰) an appeal from his friend Manlius for
consolation on the death os his wife, -perhaps the same Man-

although she has sunk so deep in degradation. In a simple,
manly way he declares the fidelity ol his love for her (c. 87),
and the condition to which he has now been brought by ber
fault and not his own (c. 7 5). However difficult it be to asso-
ciate the idea of pure affection with a passion like his, there
is, nevertheless, an appeal os tmth in his solemn asseveration
at this moment ol bitterest grief that his love sor Lesbia was
