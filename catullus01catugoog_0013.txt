xii INTRODUCTION.

of lile in the capital during this most active period in the his·
tory ol Rome, there arose a school of writers wh0, though osten
conservatives in politics, were radicals in poetry. The tenden-
cies of the traditional Roman past were by them utterly disre-
garded. Inspiration was drawn from the stirring life into which
they were plunged, as well as from the sympathetic study oi
the sources os poetic art among both the earlier Greeks and
the Alexandriana As was to be expected, their models oi
rhythm were not the rude hexameters and ruder saturnians ol
their Roman predecessors, but the more polished versification
of the Greeks 3 and their subjects were sometimes their own
personal experiences and emotions, and sometimes themes sug·
gested by their Greek prototypes. So a new school of Roman
poetry arose and flourished, to be superseded in turn by the
polished Augustans, who cultivated the niceties os elegauce, but
at the expense os verae.

Camwa

3. of this new school ol poeta the most prominent and
interesting figure is Catullus. It is possible to know him per·
sonally as only now and then an ancient writer can be known
to us, and yet he gives us but few definite biographical facts
concerning himself, while still sewer are given by other authors
oi his own and later ages. But the little body oi poems that
constitute his extant works is so replete with his intense person·
ality, and shows forth so unreservedly his every emotion, that
the man stands out before us as does no other man os the age
with the exception of two or three of its political leaders. And

⁴ all this is true, even though we acknowledge, as we are bound

to dn, that in many questions ol importance concerning bis lile
we must be content with aworking hypothesis instead of a
series of established facts, and that the biographer, as the
interpreter of the poems oi Catullus, must be understood to ba
presenting probabilitiea and not certainties.
