and was born May 28, 82 nc. (ct'. Plin. l.c.). He died in, or
uot very long before, the year 47 nc. (cf. Cic. Fam. XV. ar,
4). He was renowned as a most able and skilsul orator,
though of low stature (cf. 53. 53 Sen. Contr. VII. 4. 7 3 Ov.
Tnst. II. 431), and as awriter of epic, lyric, and epigram (cl.
Cic. Brut. 279, 2833 Tac. Dt'al. 18 ς Quint. Inst. X. r. 1153
Plin. Ep. I. 16. 53 Gell. XIX. 9. 7 ; Serv. on Verg. Ecl. 6. 47 ;
8. 4). On account oi his intimacy with Catullus and the simi-
larity ol their political principles (cs. Suet. Iul. 73) and oi
their writings they are often named together (cf. with above
Hor. Sat. I. ro. 19, and indexes to Propertius and Ovid).
The few extant fragments of his works are appended to the
editions ol Catullus by Lachmann and L. Moller. The death oi
Quintilia, apparently from the tone of c. 96 the wife of Calvus,
gave occasion for one oi the finest and most touching of the
brieter poems oi Catullus.

61. The Comificius to whom Catullus addressed the pathetic
appeal oi c. 38 was a poet (ci. vv. 7 and 8), and is doubtless
to be identified with the Cornificius mentioned by Ovid (Trist.
II. 436) in connection with other verse-writers of the period ol
Catullus. It is not so clear, though quite possible, that he is
the Q. Cornificius to whom Cicero wrote friendly letters (Fam.
XII. 17-30), dated between 45 and 43 nc. This Comificius
was an active officer of Julius Caesar, a member of the col-
lege oi augurs, and later governor of the province of Africa,
which he endeavored to hold agaInst T. Sextius, the general
oi the second triumvirate. His death is mentioned by Jerome
under date oi 41 13.c.: Cornificius poeta a militibus desertus
intenta, quos saepe jugr‘entes ‘galeatos lepores' adpellarat. Il
thisbe the friend oi Catullus, he may perhaps be counted as
another of the group of young writers won over by Caesar from
the ranks oi his political foes. His interest and activity in
rhetorical studies are distinctly indicated by Cicer0, and there
seems to be no good reason to doubt that he is the Cornificius
rhetor not infrequently quoted by Quintilian. With but slightly
