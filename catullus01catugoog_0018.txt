later, at least, the friend of Julius Caesar, might command
interest. Under the charge of one of them he might have

To which one the trust fell cannot now be determined, but as
Catullus later (c. r) addresses Cornelius Nepos as the friend
and foster-father of his earlier poems, it seems not unlikely
that to his guardianship (cf. 5 63) Catullus owed his introduc·
