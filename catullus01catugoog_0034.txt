or roughness but glide along with the utmost ease and swill
grace toward their mark. But he was no precisianist in met·
ries. His hexameters are less perfect and flexible than those
of P. Varro or of Lucretius, his elegiacs less harmonious and
melting than those ol the Augustans, his logaoedics often less
melodious than those of Horace. And nevertheless his rhyth-
mical skill suggests constantly that it is the effect of great art·
fulness.

Alexandrian poets, though it is not easy to determine the pre·
cise limits of the influence of either school upon his genius.
Partus this difficulty arise: from the meagreness of the remains
of these Greek writers that have survived the Middle Ages‚
end part from the intense fire of his own personality that has
metamorphosed into its own likeness all the material that came
into contact with it. Even when he is professedly translating
Sappho or Callimachus (cf. cc. 51, 66), his translation is full
of original elements, and is worked out in a personal fashion.
He is osten Sapphic in his tendency to sels-address‚ and in
the warmth and tendemess of his emotions, and often Alexan·
drian in his liking for episode, for richness os mythological
allusion, sor striking tums of phrase (cf. especially cc. 63, 64,
68δ passim) 3 and yet he is, after all, never other than distinc-
tively Roman.

46. The speech Catullus employa is, as might be expected
from what has already been said, the speech of every-day life.
It will not be necessary to discuss here its phenomena in
detail. It approximates closely in general to the speech oi
Plautus and Terence aud of Cicero's letters, and suggests in
some respects that of Petronius and other writers of the Silver
Age, abounding as it does in diminutives (for the expression ol
tendemess, or of scom, or even without any proper diminutive
force), in words os Greek or os provincial extraction, in alliter·
ation and anaphora. Yet in many instances in epic passages, or
those os a more elevated tone than the maiority oi his lyrica.
