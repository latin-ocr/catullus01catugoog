of all poems (except c. 11) showing a change of personatis
not of political, feeling? But this question may be reserved
for another occasion.

51. Itis not to be supposed, however, that all of these poems
saw the light for the first time after the death of their author.
The manifest point of most of the personal poems would have
been utterly lost, had they not been published immediately
after their composition, and the passage already cited from
Suetonius (lul. 73) shows clearly that Caesar was acquainted
before their author's death with some of the poems directed
against him. One poem also (c. 16, 12) contains an evident
reference to the earlier publication of c. 48 (or of cc. 5 and
7?). It seems likely, therefore, that many of the poems were
published singly, at least among the circle of the poet's friends,
while the extant dedication of a libellus to 'Cornelius Nepos
suggests thata smaller collection of them was made and pub·
lished by Catullus himself (cf. introductory note to c. r).

52. Catullus undoubtedly wrote other poems than those
included in the extant liber, but of the fragments attributed to
him by the grammarians some are proved to have been falsely
so ascribed, and the few remaining are, even if genuine, so
slight as to be insignificant (cf. Commentary on cc. 18-21).

53. The popularity enj0yed hy Catullus among the Augustan
elegiasts did not preserve his memory alive through the declin-
ing centuries of the Roman empire. The scholars and poets of
the latter half of the first millennium after Christ had forgotten
even his name. Only Rather, bishop of Verona, in a sermon
delivered there in 965 n.D., confesses that he had just become
acquainted with his writings3 and an anthology of Latin poets
written at about the same time (now coo'. mancaepammus
