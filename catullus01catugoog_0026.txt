Epp. passim Dmmann II. p. 376 ff.) coincide with those os
Lesbia, and many minor details of reference in the poems of
Catullus are thus explicable. Especially it may be noted that
Μ. Caelius Rufus (cf. cc. roo, 77, 69, 58) was a lover of this
Clodia (cf. Cic. Cael. passim) about the year 58 13.C.,and

Fabullus, the poet’s friends. The ordinary motive was not only
a love οἱ adventure, but the desire sor acquiring wealth at the
expense ol the provincials in one of the dozen ways possible
under a friendly and not too conscientious official patron.
Catullus apparently had not been povertystricken, however
jestingly he claimed that common distinction ol the society-man
at the capital, though an increase of income may not have been
without attractions for him. He had up to this time, τοο,
apparently loved Rome above all other cities‚ and had not
cared to leave it for any considerable period os time, even that
be might visit Greece. But now there were two motives that
might lead him to look with desire upon a joumey to Bithynia
