INTRODUCTION. xiii

4. With regard to his full name we are left iu some doubt.
He refers to himself by name in his poems twenty-five times,
but in each case only by the cognomen, Catullus, while the
better manuscripts of his writings are inscribed simply Catulli
Veronensis Ls'bcr. Yet there is no difficulty in ascertaining his
gentile name from other writers. Varro (L. L. VII. 50), Sue·
tonius (Iul. 73), Porphyrio (ou Hor. Sat. 1. ro. 19), Charisius
(Ι. 97), Jerome (Chron. u. Abr. 1930), all give it as Valm‘us.
There are fewer references to his praenomen. Four of the later
and interpolated manuscripts give itin their titles as Quintus,
and until lately it was supposed that to this indication might be
added the testimony of the elder Pliny (N. H. XXXVII. 81).
Relying upon such authority Scaliger went so far as to emend
c.67.1a so as to bring iu for the unintelligible words qui te
the praenomen of the poet in the vocative, Quintc,· and his
suggestion won the approval of even so keen a critic as Iach·
mann. But it is now universally conceded that the initial Q.
prefixed to the word Camllus in the passage specified from
Pliny is an interpolation, the best Ms, the codex Bambcr·
gensis, containing only the cognomen without prefix. There is,
moreover, positive evidence in favor of a different praenomen.
Jerome (La), in speaking of the birth of the poet, calls him in
full C. Valen'us Catullus, and Apuleius (Apol. ιο), whose ac·
curacy, however, fn the matter of names is not above suspicion,
calis him C. Camllus. In the face, then, of the testimony
of interpolated manuscripts only, his praenomen must stand
established as Gaius.

5. Conceming the birthplace of Gaius Valerius Catullus
there is abundant testimony. The titles of the best MSS. of
bis works call him Veronensis, and Jerome (lc.) declares him
born at Verona. In this testimony concur his admirers among
the poets of the centuries immediately following (cg. Ov. Am.
ΙΙΙ. ις. 7 ; Mart. 1. 61. 1; X. 1⁰3· 53 XIV. 1953 Auson. Op.
²3· 1) ; and his own writings fumish confirmatory evidence oi
