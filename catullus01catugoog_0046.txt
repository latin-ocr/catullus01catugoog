ol friendship with Catullus by becoming a lover ol Lesbia. In
c. 80. 1 the youth of Gellius is indicated, and in all the series
except c. 116 he is charged with various abhorrent crimes The
most acceptable suggestion of his identity was originally made
by Pantagathus (†r578), who judged him to be that son of Ι.
Gellius Publicola (consul 72 ac) who is said by Valerius
Maximus (V. 9. 1) to have been accused before the senate ol
iu nouercam (cs. c. 88. 1, etc) commissum stuprum et patrici
dium cogitatum. This younger Gellius was himself consul in
36 nc, and his age therefore also accords with the intimations

with the Gellius Publicola attached by Cicero in Pro Sestr'o 51.

been mentioned (ὅ 38). That he is identical with the ‘ Men·

comparing the wealth and extravagance of the two men (cc.
114 and 115 with cc. 29, 41, and 43), their literary preten-

rr 5. 7-8 with cc. 29. 7-8 and 57). These latter indications,
however, but support that os c. ²9· 13, and would not inde·
pendently establish the identity.

74. Α sufficient biography os Mamurra is given by Pliny
(N. H. XXXVI. 6. 48), who says he was an eques os Formias
and praefectus fabrum of Caesar in Gaul, and quotes Nepos as
authority for the statement that Mamurra first of the Romans
incrusted the entire walls of his house on the Caelian with mar·
