died before 1330), celebrated in a few enigmatic verses (cl.
Critical Appendix ad fin.) the rediscovery ol the text ol Catul-
lus ‘nnder a bushel,' apparently at Verona. From this MS„
or from copies of it, numemus Italian scholars, among them
Petrarch, early learned to know the poet. The original MS.
soon disappeared, and has never been lound ς but two descend·
ants oi it, apparently not more than one generation removed,
are preserved to us, and lorm the basis ol the present text ol
Catullus. One of these copies, ordinarily called G (now No.
14,137 in the National Library at Paris) was made in the year
1375, and the other, 0 (No. goos the Canonici Latin Mss. in
the Bodleian Library) at about the same time. (Cf. also intro·

upon interpolated MSS, and though displaying great erudition
and classical taste left much to be desired in the way of true
principles of textual criticism. The edition ol Karl Lachmann
(Berlin, 1829) first established the textos Catullus upon a

scientific basis, though the two MSS. on which he mainly
depended, D and L (in the Royal Library at Berlin), are lar
inferior to G and 0. These became first known to the world,
G in 1830 through I. Sillig (Jahrb. fiir Plrz'lol. xiii. p. 262 fl),
and Othrough Robinson Ellis in his first edition ol Catullus
(Oxlord, 1867). During the last quarter of a century, then,
the constitution as well as the elucidation of the textos Catullus
has made its most marked advances.

55. A few of the persons distinguished by the love or by the
hatred of Catullus may conveniently be mentioned here. Some
such persons, however, as Caesar, Cicero, and Clodius, are so
well known otherwise to the ordinary reader as to need no
biographical notice ina work of this sort. Others, like lesbia,
have been sufficiently noticed in previous paragraphs of this
Introduction. Still others are ol so little present importante,
