FOREWORD

This reappearance of Merrill's Catullus perhaps calls for
a word ol explanation. A few years ago, when the book was
allowed to go out of print, classical studies suffered a severe
blow. For this was the only brief, sufficiently annotated edi·
tion available in English of the complete works of one ol
antiquity's most attractive poets.

Admittedly, one may always find fault with notes written
inthe knowledge and taste of halfacentury ago. Forexample,
one may now tend to deplore the emphasis given to matters
concerned with the chronology of the poems. But a later
generation may not. Then, too, some today may possibly,
on grounds of aesthetic improbability, reject Merrill’s in-
clination to “partition the poet’s Muse,'’ so that two Catul-
luses emerge, the learned and the lyrical. More serious,
certainly, is the considerable increase in our knowledge since
1893 of Catullus' relation to his Greek models. But our chief
need is to have such basic commentaries as those of Ellis or
Kroll brought up to date. F inally, some would inevitably
have Merrill’s text changed here and there. Still, in the case
of so thorny a text quot doctores tot lectiones

The alternative, then, to reprinting would have been a
novus libellus-a new recension and commentary-and to
that proposal the answerissimply nummi desunt. In any case
Merrill's notes furnish ample and pertinent assistance on all
points that are likely to bother the student, and for the in-
structor they offer now and then the not wholly undesirable

challenge to differ from another scholar in interpretation and
to try to supplement him in information. All in all, this
«edition indeed deserves to last plus uno saeclo, and one is very
glad to have it back. N
