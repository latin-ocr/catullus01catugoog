xxvi INTRODUCTION.

brother (cf ᾗ 22). In the second place, he had been passing
through a terrible mental struggle that was perhaps not yet over,
and Rome had become painful to him. In the distraction of
travel and residence in a foreign clime he might find that
absence from himself for which he sighed.

30. How he obtained the appointment we do not know, for
there is no earlier reference to Memmius in his poems‚ and
none but uncomplimentary references to him later. But it is
not strange that with all his circle of literary friends at Rome he
should command influence enough to secure such a post3 nor
is it strange that C. Memmius, himself a learned man and a
verse-writer (Cic. Brut. 70. 247 ; Ov. Tn'st. 11. 4335 Plin. Ep.
V. 3. 5 3 Gell. XIX. 9. 7), was pleased to have the company in
his province of such menas Catullus and his poet-friend, C.
Helvius Cinna (c. 10. 31).

probability ruled over Bithynia in 57-56 nc, though this fact
cannot be substantiated from other sources. Of the joumey
of Catullus to Bithynia and of his stay there we have no
record up to the period of his approaching return to Italy,
save in the one poem (c. 101) in which he commemorates the
funeral-offerings at the grave of his brother in the Troad, and
speaks the last farewell,-a farewell of infinite sadness because
spoken with no hope ofa future reunion. To make these
offerings of pious affection was one of the motives of Catullus
in coming to this distant land, and doubtless the sad duty was
not long postponed after his arrival there. What were the
other occupations of his life in Bithynia we cannot tell. No
poems remain, at any rate, to mark the pleasures of social
intercourse, no squibs of raillery, no brilliant bits of fancy,
such as distinguish the Roman days of the poet. The year is
along silence. Perhaps he was too sad to write ; perhaps
the irksomeness and dulness of his official life wore hard
upon his Muse ; perhaps, however, he was gathering inspira-
tion from their native scenery and legend for those poems ol
