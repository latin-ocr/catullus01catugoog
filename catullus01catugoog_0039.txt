urnviii INTRODUCHON.

or are so little known to us outside the mention of them by
Catullus, that the brief references to thern in the commentary
on the individual poems may suffice. The names of all these,
with references to the poenis in which they are addressed οι
mentioned, may be found in the Index of Proper Names at
the end of this volume.

56. It is a temptation to identify the Alfenus to whom the
rentonstrance of c. 3⁰ is addressed with P. Alfenus Varus, consul
sufflatus 39 ac, especially if he, in turn, ean be identified with
the Alfenus Varus who protected Vergil’s property at Mantua
(Ecl. 1, 6, 9), who was perhaps a native of Cremona (though
falsely identified by the scholiasts on Horace with Alfenus anser
of Sal. I. 3.13o). For if Varus was at Cremona during the
winter and spring of 5 5—54 rac, while Catullus was at Verona
(cf. §40), we perhaps have a lrey to the difference in tone
between c. 30 and c. 38. From Cornificius at Rome the poet
could expect in his growing illuess only written comfort, and that
is all he asks. Alfenus Varus at Cremona was within easy reach-
ing distance of Verona bya direct higlrway, the Via Postumia,
aud might have visited Catullus in person, but did not. Hence
che deeper feeling of slight with which Catullus addresses him.

57. The ‘Pollio frater’ of c. 12. 6 is very likely the only
Pollio known to us from this period, C. Asinius, Cn. f. (born
75 ac, died 5 mn), who became praetor in 45 ae. and consul
in 40, in which year he gained a triumph over the Parthini. At
first a Caesarian, he might have been won over to the senato-
rial party after Caesar’s death, but finally cast in his lot with
Antonius, from whom, however, he became alienated, but
without entering the circle of the intimate friends of Augustus.
As orator, dramatic and lyric poet, historiari of the first trium·
virate, and literary critic, he gained lasting fame, and is fre·
quently quoted by succeeding writers. Among his intimate
friends were Vergil and Horace; cf. Verg. Ecl. 3. 843 43 8. 6;
Hor. Carm. II. r; Sat. I. 10. 42, 85.

58. Nothing further is known of the older brother of Pollia
