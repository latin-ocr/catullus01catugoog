xvi INTRODUCTION.

the tastes and inclinations of Catullus as the father of Horace
had with those of his son. Catullus, moreover, was not the
only son, and was probably younger than the one whose un·
timely death in the Troad he records.

10. Yet there was apparently wealth enough in the family to
enable even the younger brother to enjoy the advantages that
wealth brought to the young Italian of that day. He was able
early in his young manhood to go to Rome, and to make that
city thenceforth his abidingplace (c. 68. 34 ft). He owned a
villa at Sirmio (c. 31), and another on the edge of the Sabine
hills (c. 44). And there is no indication that while at Rome he
was busy with any pursuit that could fill his purse, although,
like many another young Roman, he later obtained a provincial
appointment, and went to Bithynia on the staff of the governor
Memmius in the hope of wealth (cf. ξ 29 ft). The hope, he
tells us (cc. ro, 28), proved abortive, but Catullus had yet
money enough—perhaps even to purchase a yacht for his
homeward journey like any millionnaire (cf. f 35 and intro·
ductory note to c. 4) —at any rate to continue his merry life
at Rome, apparently without great pecuniary embarrassment.
All these indications point to no financial inability or niggard-
liness on the part of his father. Possibly the villas, and an in-
crease of income, carne to him upon the death of his brother.

11. Whether Catullus, like Horace, was accompanied to
Rome by his father is doubtful. On the whole, it seems
hardly probable that he was. To say nothing of the con-
siderations possibly connected with the interests of the elder
son, the father was apparently resident in Verona at the time
when Julius Caesar was governor of Gaul (Suet. Iul. 73), and
this fact may indicate that at no time was the family home at

'Verona broken up in favor of a new one at Rome.

Eoucnnou.

12. Doubtless to the care of some friend of the family
at Rome the youth was entrusted. And there were many
