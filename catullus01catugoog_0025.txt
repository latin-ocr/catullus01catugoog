and the hope ol budding fortune (cs.§ 41), to win him back
to her, his reply was one ol bitter scom lorber, though joined
with a touch of sorrowsul reminiscence os departed joys.

27. As partos the history ol Catullus alter the break with
Lesbia has thus been anticipated in order to indicate the course
ol his struggle with himself, it may be well to pause here a lew
moments longer to ask who this Lesbia was. That we have in
the poems ol Catullus a real and not an imaginative sketch ol
a love-episode cannot be once doubted by him who reads.
Lesbia is not a lay figure, a mere peg on which to hang fancies,
like the shadowy heroines ol Horace. That she was no liber-
tina, but a woman os education and of social position, is equally
clear from the passages already cited The name Lesbia, there-
fore, is immediately suggestive os a pseudonym, and not only
the lashions ol poetry, but the position of the lady herself,
appear at once to justify this expedient on the part os her poet-

P. Clodius Pulcher, Cicero’s soe, wife of Q. Caecilius Metellus
Celer, who was praetor ae. 63, then governor of Cisalpine
Gaul, consul sor the year 60 nc, and died in 59, not without
suspicion that his wife poisoned him (cs. Cic. Cael. ²4· 60 ;
Quint. VIII. 6. 53). Among almost all Catullian scholars ol
the present century this view has found acceptance, in spite

of the express dissent of a few. The general character and
course >ol lile of this Clodia ‘Quadrantaria' (cs. Cic. Cael. and
