faintness that seizes upon him even while he feels himself a
god, and more than a god, in sharing her smile and her voice.
And with the swift passion comes the mad desire to win her
love. Lesbia is a married woman (c. 83. Ι), but that consider-
ation demands only additional care and diplomacy on his part,
and is no bar to his efforts. He lays siege to her heart. His im-
portunate persistence, youth as he is, commands her attention
even amid a throng of lovers, but apparently only irritates her.
What does this youngster‚ lately come to Rome, hope for amid
so many of his betters? He sees that victory must be won over
this brilliant woman of the world by proving himself no mere

delight in multitudinous kisses (cc. 5, 7), daintiest pretence of
lover's jealousy at the lavors accorded Lesbia’s sparrow (c. 2),
gentle, half-smiling synipathy with her over the untimely death

of her pet (c. 3), flow from his pen with a perfect freedom ol
movement and yet with an exquisite grace and perfection in
everypart. And the merethoughtthatanyproud damsel could
once claim comparison with his Lesbia rouses him to hot scorn
(⁶0- 43, 86)-

18. The sight of this young poet at her feet may have been
attractive to Lesbia, but it could not take the place of all other
