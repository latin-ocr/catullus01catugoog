addressed in c. 12. The family of the Asinii sprang from Teate,
‘he capital of the Marrucini, but it is doubtful whether Marru-
cine in c. 12. 1 is simply a distinguishing epithet. C. Asinius
Pollio is the first of the family known to bear a cognomen, and
perhaps that custom was introduced in his generation, his elder
brother taking the cognomen Marrucinus from the seat of the
family.

59. The Caelius of c. 58 is probably identical with the Caelrus
of cc. 82 and 100, and with the Rufus of cc. 69 and 77 (and also
cc. 73 and 59 ?), the names and circumstances suggesting M.
Caelius Rufus, born, according to Pliny (N. H. Vll. 165), on
tbe same day with C. Licinius Calvus, May 28, 82 uc, (though
perhaps this date is too late, by a few years, for the birth of
Caelius). caeiius is well known as an ambitious politician and
an orator (Cic. Bmt. 79. ²733 Quint. Inst. v1. 3. 693 X. 1.
