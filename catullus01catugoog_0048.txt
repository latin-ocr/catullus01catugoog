ῃ. Pom Inunrc Tnnrmnn (c. 4). Perhaps c. 29 is in the
same metre; butes. note on Mammam in 1, 3,

78. unumunurm (c. 52, and perhaps c. 29), with the
optional substitution os a spondee lor the sust iambus ol any

dipody. The scheme, then, is,—
ΙΙόΞζυ-ὂΙίυ-ὂΙ-ὐ-ΛΙΙ·

79. Cuounumc or Senzou (cc. 8, 22, 31, 37, 39, 44, 59, ⁶0).
The scheme is as follows : -

ΙΙῦΞ-ὐΙ-ῧΙζυΙ-υΙίΙζυΙΙ.

Thrice also the thesis is resolved (in cc. 22. 193 37. 5; 59. 3,
-unless in c. 37. 5 we read constituere as a quadrisyllable).

80. Inunrc Ternarirran Cnrarscne, otherwise called lam·

5ο, 5 3-58δ). The scheme is,—

ΗέΞΙ-υυΙζυΙ-υΙΔυΙΙ.

It may be remarked that while the verse most frequently opens
with the irrational trochee (as always in Martial), there are
nearly seventy exceptions to this rule‚ and they are about
evenly divided between the regular trochaic opening and that
with the iambus. The peculiar experiment with this metre
tried in cc. 55 and 58⁵ is noted in the introduction to c. 55.

82. Garcomc and Punnocnnnc series are combined by
Catullus as follows:-

α. Asecond Glycouic catalectic followed bya second Phere-
cratic acatalectic forms the verse called Pallenen, used io c. 17.

The scheme is,-
