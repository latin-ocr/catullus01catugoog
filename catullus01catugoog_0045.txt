journey to Spain like the laterone with PIso (cf. ς 70) may
well have been on the staff of a provincial govemor,-prob·
ably about 60 uc, as the reference to Lesbia indicates (cf
c. 1 ‚11n.).

γὲ. The Piso unfavorably commented upon in cc. 28 and 47
(cf. i 68) is probably L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul in
58 nc. (the year of Cicero’s exile), and in 57-55 governor ol
Macedonia, where he made an honorable record. After his re·
turn to Rome in 55 nc. he attempted to reply to certain stric-
tures of Cicero uttered in his absence, and drew down upon
himself the overwhelming invective power of his adversary in
the famous speech In Pisonem, in which the whole life, char·
aeter, and actions of Piso were held up to undeserved obloquy.

71. Τὴε service of Catullus on the staff of C. Memmius
governor of Bithynia, has already been discussed (i 29 ft).
Couceming Memmius himself we may add further that neither
his political nor his personal character was above reproach.
He was in 54 nc. party to a most barefaced attempt to secure
the consulship by bribing the consuls of that year (Cic. Art.
IV. 18. 2), and was charged with the seduction of the wives
of Lucullus (Cic. Art. Ι. 18. 3) and Pompey (Suet. Gram.

14). He appears to better advantage as a scholar and the
patron of literary meu, especially of Lucretius, who dedicated
his great poem to him. Cicero (Brut. 70. 247) speaks well
of his Greek scholarship, and of his ability in oratory, though
blamiug him for lack of application. Accused of ambitus in
53 nc, on account of the operations of the preceding year,
he went into exile in Greece (cf. cie. Fam. XIII. 1), where he
died about the year 49.

72. Prominent among the invective poems of Catullus is a
group directed against a certain Gellius. This comprises cc. 74,
80, 88, 89, 90, 91, 116, but the poems are not arranged in
chronological order. Apparently the earliest ln composition is
c. 116, and the second c. 91, -the first indicating that Catullus
had tried to avert the hostility of Gelhus by sending him trans·
