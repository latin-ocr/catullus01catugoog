CATULLUS.

Puella nam mi, quae meo sinu fugit,

Amata tanturn quantum amabitur nulla,

Pro qua mihi sunt magna bella pugnata,
Consedit istic. Hanc boni beatique

Omnes amatis, et quidem, quod indignum est,
Omnes pusilli et semitarii moechi:

Tu praeter omnes une de capillatiS,
Cuniculosae Celtiberiae fili,

Egnati, opaca quern bonurn facit barba

Et dens Hibera defricatus urina.
