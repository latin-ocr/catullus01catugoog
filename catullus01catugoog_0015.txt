6. The year os his birth and that os his death are stated by
Jerome in his edition of the Chronicles of Eusebius, probably
on the authority os the De Poetis of Suetonius. Under date ol
rhe year ol Abraham 1930 (= ac. 87) Jerome says, Gaius
Valerius Catullus emptor lyn'cm Veronae nascitur, and under
that os 1960, or, according to some MSS, 1959 (= ac. 57, or
58), he says, Catullus XXX. aetatis anna Romae marim.
There is nothing to contradict Jerome’s date for the birth of
the poet, but unfortunately sor our behel in his entire accuracy,
a number of the poems of Catullus were clearly written later
than rac. 57, -some of thern at least as late as the end of the
year 55 nc, or the beginning ol the year 54 (eg. cc. 11, 29, 53,
113). Jerome is, therefore, certainly wrong about the date ol
the poet’s death, and hence about at least one ol the two other
statements, the date of his birth and his age at death. The
only scrap os evidence from other sources on these points is the
vague statement of Ovid that Catullus died young (Am. III. 9.
62 abuius huic [in Elysio] hedera iuuenale'a cinctus tempora
cum Calua, lacte Catulle, tua).

7. The poems of Catullus himself fumish us, however, with
some good negative evidence conceming the date of his death.
It probably occurred in the year 54 nc. In the first place,
there are no poems that clearly must have been written later
than the close of the year 55 ne, or the earlier months of the
year 54, nor any that are even capable of more ready explana·
