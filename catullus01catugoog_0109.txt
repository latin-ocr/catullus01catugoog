CATU‘LLUS. [30. 1-

Alfene immernor atque unanimis false sodalibus,
Iam te nil miseret, dure, tui dulcis amiculi?
Iam me prodere, iam non dubitas fallere, perfide?
Nec facta impia fallacum hominum caelicolis placent:
5 Quae tu neglegis, ac me miserum deseris in malis,
Eheu, quid faciant, dic, homines, cuiue habeant fidem?
Certe tute iubebas animam tradere, inique, me
Inducens in amorem, quasi tuta omnia mi forent.
Idem nunc retrahis te ac tua dicta omnia factaque
ιο Ventos irrita ferre ac nebulas aerias sinis.
