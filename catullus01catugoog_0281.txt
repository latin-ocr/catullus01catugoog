226 CRITICAL APPENDIX.

the first and second pages, and again on iol. 21 r.‚ on the opening verses
of c. 64.

In a pocket inside the back cover oi the book are five sheets os note·
paper oi four pages each containing variant readings, and headed Varie
lectiones cod- ms· catulli memb· t'n fl sec· XIV· apud Ab· canonici cum
edn- Aldina 15⁰2 collati. Just below and to the right on the same page
is written, apparently by the same hand, but at a later date, coeperam in
gratiam Laurentii Santenii, sed non absolui, neque ei mist¹ quicquam.
The first oi these readings is arido modo . . (1. 2), and the last (appar-
ently) sanna esset nunc quod gannit. . (83. 4).

A iacsimile oi f01.26u.(64. 336-366) by the collotype process is given
in the edition of Catullus by Robinson Ellis (Oxtord, 18782) ; lacsimiles of
sol. 13r. (50. 3-51· 12) and fol. zou. (63. 57-87) were published by Mt.
Ellis in his XII. Facsimiles from Latin MSS. in the Bodleian Library
(1885); a reduced facsimile of fol. 21 r. follows the preiace to this volume,
and since it has passed through the press a facsimile oi the same page by
the heliographic process has come to hand as plate XVa in the Pale'o·
graphia des Classiques Latim of M. Chatelain (Paris, 1892).

Codex Songermanemr's (G), now No. 14,137 of the Latin MSS. in the
National Library in Paris, formerly No. 1,165 in the library oi the abbey
oi St·Germain·des·Pres. Its subscription shows it to have been written in
the year 13753 and even ii the words et cetera there occurring are taken
as an indication that its scribe was bnt copying from a longer subscription of
the year 1375, the style of the writing shows that this copy could not bave
been made much later than that date. The bools contains the works oi
Catullus only, and is described by Schwabe as consisting of 36 leaves oi
parchment, each 243 centimeters long and 16.9 centimeters wide, with 33
lines of writing on a page. The last page, however, contains 34 lines.
The text presente many erasures and corrections, the very large majority of
which, at any rate, were made either by the original copyist, or by another
not iar removed from him in time. The copyist of Gseems to have been
somewhat more sophisticated than the copyist of 0, and (as the subscrip·
tion also intimatas) to have been more worried about the condition of the
text he was reproducing. The result is that the more ignorant blunders
committed or perpetuated in 0 are often the better guide to the readings
oi the common original oi the two MSS. A heliographic facsimile oi two

adjoining pages os G, fol. 35 u. and 36 r. (110. 7-116. 8), forms plate XV.
in the Pale‘ographie des Classiques Latim of M. Chatelain, and the entire
MS. has recently been reproduced in excellent {acsimile by a photolitho·
graphio process (Paris, Leroux, 1890).
