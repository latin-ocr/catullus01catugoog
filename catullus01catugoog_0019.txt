xviii INTRODUCTION.

15. ln life at Rome, then, Catullus t'ound his full develop-
ment as a poet. Already from the donning os the toga uirz'lri,

so he tells us (c. 68. 15 ft), he had been busied with love and
love-verses. But whether this period antedated or followed hir
coming to Rome cannot be decided, since the date os publica·
tion oi the Chronica of Nepos (c. 1. 8) is unknown, and on this
alone could a decision os the other point be based. Such
poems as those that concern Aufilena (cc. roo, 110, 111) may
possibly date from the Veronese period of the poet's life
(though c. 82 cannot possibly do so), and yet it is just as
possible that their scene was Rome (cs. introductory note to
c.1oo),and the same may be said of the poems conceming
Ameana (cc. 41, 43). Much more likely is it, however, that
of the other poems that show some connection with Veronese
affairs cc. 17 and 67 date from his residence in his native city,
while c. 35 was surely written during only a temporary visit
there (cs. Commentary).

Lusum.

16. But whenever these poems were written, they spring
from experiences that did not touch deeply the soul os the
writer. A passing fancy, a moment's passion, an evanescent
humor brought them forth. But at Rome, and not long after
he arrived at Rome, Catullus met the mastering passion os his
life, and beside the verses to which it gave birth the melodious
chamber ditties os Horace and the elaborated passions of the
elegiasts are but as tinkling cymbals. To the woman who exer·
cised this wonderful power over him he gives the name os Lesbia.
But more often he is not content with a name, and the familiar
terms os endearment flow from his lips with a newer and deeper
meaning ; sor he delights to feel that though his experience
ison the outside like that of other men, his mistress is peerless
in virtues and his love sor her a love passing that os women.
On his side the passion was sudden and intense. He adopts
the words os Sappho, and tells Lesbia (c. 51) of the deadly
